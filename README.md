## Multicellular INtegration Analysis
`mina` provides a bridge between single-cell data analysis workflows from `scverse`, factor based models from `MOFAflex`, and prior knowledge to generate tissue-centric descriptions from single-cell data.

This package facilitates the implementation of [Multicellular Factor Analysis](https://elifesciences.org/articles/93161) by providing functions to process and format single-cell data into a multi-view format, together with additional visualization and downstream tasks to analyse and interpret multicellular programs.

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.12 or newer installed on your system.
If you don't have Python installed, we recommend installing [uv].

MINA currently targets the development version of MOFA-FLEX.

## Version status

MINA is currently pre-1.0. APIs may change between minor versions.

The `0.1.x` series introduces a revised API and is not fully backward-compatible with `0.0.x`.

There are several alternative options to install MINA:

<!--
1) Install the latest release of `MINA` from [PyPI][]:

```bash
pip install MINA
```
-->

1. Install the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/saezlab/MINA.git@main
```

Optional integrations are installed via extras:

- `spatial` installs `squidpy` for spatial neighborhood features.
- `patpy` installs the patient-representation integration.
- `liana` installs ligand-receptor analysis support.

For example:

```bash
pip install "mina[spatial]"
pip install "mina[spatial,patpy]"
```

In a local development checkout managed with `uv`, sync the corresponding extras instead:

```bash
uv sync --extra spatial
uv sync --extra spatial --extra patpy
```
